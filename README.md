# starling-cli

A command line client for Starling Bank

The commands listed below haven't yet been implemented. I'm currently 
experimenting with the command syntax that tries to represent common 
banking activities in an intuitive way.

```plain
list transactions
list transactions card
list transactions fpsIn
list transactions fpsOut
list transactions dd
list mandates
list payments
list contacts
list goals
list addresses
list account
list balance
list card

transfer to goal
transfer from goal
```

## To-Do

```plain
create contact
create goal
```
